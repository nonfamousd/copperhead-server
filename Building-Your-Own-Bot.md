# Build your own CopperHead bot

We encourage developers to build their own AI-controlled CopperHead bots to play with or to compete against other humans and bots in CopperBot Competitions.

The server can launch the default CopperBot AI opponent, which is implemented in the provided `copperbot.py` file. Modify this file guided by the instrucntions below to create your own bot with different strategies.

## Understanding CopperHead Bots

TODO: Add details about CopperHeat bot architecture, key functions, and how it interacts with the server.

### Information provided by the server to clients

TODO: Provide an overview of the game state information sent by the server to clients, including competition state, player positions, food locations, buffs, etc.

### Commands sent by bots to the server

TODO: Provide an overview of the commands that bots may use to control their snakes, including movement directions and any special actions.

## Getting Started

TODO: Provide simple step-by-step instructions for setting up a development environment, creating a new GitHub repo with bot code based on `copperbot.py`, and connecting to a CopperHead server. Include one specific example of modifying code to improve the bot.

## Bot API Reference

TODO: Provide a detailed reference of the bot API, aimed at beginner developers.
